            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In autonomous vehicles, computers assume the core control tasks. Through vehicle - mounted sensors such as lidar, cameras, and millimeter - wave radars, data about the vehicle's surrounding environment are continuously collected. This data includes information such as road conditions, the positions and movement states of other vehicles and pedestrians. Computers process and analyze these large amounts of complex data at high speeds. They utilize advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence technologies for target recognition, path planning, and decision - making. For example, when it detects that the vehicle in front suddenly decelerates, the computer quickly calculates a safe deceleration or evasion path and sends precise commands to the vehicle's power, steering, and braking systems, enabling the vehicle to respond automatically.
